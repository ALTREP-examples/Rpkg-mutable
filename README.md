# The `mutable` Package

This package explores the possibility of using the `ALTREP` framework
to provide mutable vectors in R that behave in a reasonable way.
There are some major issues with this that might be resolvable, but
for the moment this seems to be problematic. More detailed discussion
of the issues is available in a vignette.
